## Project Structure
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
- Backend: Flask
- Data: SQLite (database), SQLAlchemy (object relational mapper), SQL (querying the data)
- Visualizations: Tableau and Matplotlib
- Data Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy

## What I Learned
- Databases: Gained experience constructing schema tables for a relational database management system (SQLite) as well as using SQLAlchemy for building upon Python's object-oriented nature.
- Full Stack Development: Gained a firm understanding of integrating backend and frontend features in a web application.
- SQL: Wrote SQL queries to extract insights from the database that were then visualized using plotting packages.

## Future Considerations
1. Improve the data visualizations: I choose to use the matplotlib package to make visualizations for the "Your Cart" page but in the future I would like to use a more interactive plotting package. I would also like to provide more insights and graphs for the user.
2. Explore the data: I used Tableau for some basic data exploration, but given more time, I would like to explore the dataset further.
3. More features: I've recently become interested in recommender systems and I think adding a feature that recommends healthier products based on a person's grocery cart could be really beneficial.
