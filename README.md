## What It Does

## Demo

## Project Structure
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
- Backend: Flask
- Data: SQLite (database), SQLAlchemy (object relational mapper), SQL (querying the data
- Visualizations: Tableau and Matplotlib
- Data Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy

## What I Learned

## Future Considerations
1. Improve the data visualizations: I choose to use the matplotlib package to make visualizations for the "Your Cart" page but in the future I would like to use a more interactive plotting package. I would also like to provide more insights and graphs for the user.
2. Explore the data: I used tableau for some basic data exploration but give more time I would like to explore the dataset further.
