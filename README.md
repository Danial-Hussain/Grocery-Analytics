## Project Structure
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
- Backend: Flask
- Data: SQLite (database), SQLAlchemy (object relational mapper), SQL (querying the data)
- Visualizations: Tableau and Matplotlib
- Data Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy

## What I Learned
This project allowed me to grasp a better understanding of two key concepts the first of which is databases. Constructing schema tables and writing SQL queries, I was quickly introduced to the intricacies of databases. Additionally, I also gained experience using SQLAlchemy which builds upon the object-oriented nature of python when interacting with databases. In addition to databases, I gained a firm understanding of full-stack development and how the frontend components interact with the backend components in an application.

## Future Considerations
1. Improve the data visualizations: I choose to use the matplotlib package to make visualizations for the "Your Cart" page but in the future I would like to use a more interactive plotting package. I would also like to provide more insights and graphs for the user.
2. Explore the data: I used Tableau for some basic data exploration, but given more time, I would like to explore the dataset further.
